A self-balancing two-wheel robot using an Arduino Uno R3 and MPU6050 IMU demonstrates real-time control and feedback-based stabilization. The MPU6050’s DMP provides pitch data to a PID controller, which continuously adjusts motor speed to keep the robot upright.

The project emphasizes PID tuning (Kp, Ki, Kd), showing how small changes impact stability, response, and oscillations, and highlights the gap between theoretical control and real hardware behavior. It offers hands-on experience in sensor processing, control algorithms, and hardware–software integration.
